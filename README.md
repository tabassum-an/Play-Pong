#🏓 Play-Pong
A simple and fun two-player Pong game created using Python's built-in `turtle` graphics module with options to reset, pause and escape.


## 🎮 Features

- Two-player gameplay
- Paddle movement using `W/S` and `↑/↓`
- Dynamic ball speed increases on paddle hit
- Victory condition (first to 5 points)
- Pause (`P`), Reset (`R`), and Exit (`Esc`) controls
- Real-time score tracking and game over message

## 🏁 Winning the Game

The first player to reach 5 points wins. The game displays a "Player A/B Wins!" message when the condition is met.


### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- The game uses only the standard `turtle` and `sys` modules, so no additional libraries are required.
